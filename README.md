## Recogition
The digit recognition is done using CNN (convolutional neural network) with tensor flow and keras.
The MNIST handwritten digit dataset was used for training the model.
Pre-trained model is included with the project. Function for training a new model is also present in the code. Feel free to experiment with netowrk and create new models.
